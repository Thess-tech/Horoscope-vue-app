             "description": "Despite the word aqua in its name, Aquarius is actually the last air sign of the zodiac. Aquarius is represented by the water bearer, the mystical healer who bestows water, or life, upon the land. Accordingly, Aquarius is the most humanitarian astrological sign. These revolutionary thinkers fervently support “power to the people,” aspiring to change the world through radical social progress. Every Aquarian is a rebel at heart: These air signs despise authority and anything that represents conventionality. Free-spirited and eccentric, they can often be identified by their offbeat fashion sensibilities, unusual hobbies, and nonconformist attitude. Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet that governs innovation, technology, and surprising events. Uranus perfectly mirrors Aquarius's distinctive attitude, complementing the nontraditional nature of these visionary air signs. Aquarians are big thinkers, but mustn't forget their immediate surroundings. These water bearers can become so focused on implementing widespread reform that they neglect their family and friends, gaining a reputation for being aloof and distant in relationships.\n\n\nAquarians should remember that progress always starts on a micro level and advocate empathy and compassion wherever possible. Like Taurus, Leo, and Scorpio, the other fixed signs of the zodiac, Aquarius can have a bit of a stubborn streak. This is often considered an Achilles heel. In fact, in medical astrology Aquarius governs the ankles. Aquarian obstinacy stems from strong, righteous conviction and it's quelled as soon as an Aquarius gets the chance to enact change. Because these water bearers are so deeply motivated by the spirit of egalitarianism, they enjoy teamwork and participating in communities of like-minded individuals. However, Aquarians also need plenty of space and time on their own to reflect, form ideas, and plan their role in the revolution. Ultimately, freedom is of the utmost importance for Aquarians, who view challenges to their independence as power-hungry attempts to control them. To win an Aquarian's trust, don't try to reign in their quirks or keep them from flying their freak flag high — Aquarius thrives on shock value.",

Bold and ambitious, Aries dives headfirst into even the most challenging situations (which is appropriate, since the body part associated with Aries is the head). Like their fellow fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. Uncomplicated and direct in their approach, they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances. They like things quick and dirty, a temperament also reflected in their sexual proclivities. Aries is a cardinal sign that kicks off not only the spring season but also the entire zodiac wheel. Astrologers believe that each sign learns the lessons absorbed by its preceding signs, both joyful and painful. In the case of Aries, however, there is no inherited wisdom: Aries leads with blind optimism, barreling through life with an electric joie de vivre that perfectly complements their distinctive impulsivity. These fire signs think after they leap, which often results in lessons learned the hard way. Aries represents the singular spirit (while Aries’s opposite sign, Libra, symbolizes partnership). These rams adhere to an “every person for themselves” philosophy. While this self-determination can be inspiring,\n\n\nAries needs to watch out for selfish tendencies. This sign is ruled by Mars, the dynamic red planet named after the Roman god of war. Accordingly, these courageous rams are always armed and ready for battle. Aries is known for an explosive temper, and although their outbursts don’t last long, it’s definitely best to avoid fiery rams until the steam has dissipated. But when these brazen rams are not flying off the handle, they’re upbeat, positive, and playful creatures who enjoy living life to the fullest. You can always spot an Aries excelling on the sports field, speeding down the highway, or organizing a vibrant party game.",

            "description": "Cancer is a cardinal water sign. Represented by the crab, this oceanic crustacean seamlessly weaves between the sea and shore, representing Cancer’s ability to exist in both emotional and material realms. Cancers are highly intuitive and their psychic abilities manifest in tangible spaces: For instance, Cancers can effortlessly pick up the energies in a room. These crabs are highly sensitive to their environments, as well as extremely self-protective. Much like their celestial spirit animal, Cancers are shielded by hard, external shells. At first, these crabs may be perceived as cold or distant. With time, though, Cancers reveal their gentle nature, genuine compassion, and mystical capabilities. Just don't be surprised if it takes a while to get to know them. Cancer is ruled by the moon, the celestial body that represents comfort, self-care, and maternal energies. Accordingly, Cancers tend to be domestically oriented. They love to create cozy, safe spaces that serve as their personal sanctuaries, then spend lots of time in them. Cancers care deeply about their families and are quick to adopt caregiver roles. But these crabs must be careful: When Cancers invest in someone emotionally, they risk blurring the line between attentive nurturing and controlling behavior.\n\n\nCancers attract friends and lovers through their loyalty, commitment, and emotional depth. These crustaceans make excellent hosts and enjoy entertaining with comfort food and free-flowing libations. (Cancer rules the stomach, so there’s nothing these crabs love more than a home-cooked meal.) If you're not a fan of Cancer’s attachment to the home, that may be a bit of a problem. Though these celestial crabs avoid direct conflict by walking at an angle, they can inflict a harsh pinch with their distinctive brand of passive-aggressiveness. It may be difficult to convince a Cancer to talk openly about what's bothering them, but if you can do it without making them feel threatened, you'll build long-lasting trust.",

            "description": "Capricorns are known to be extremely hardworking visionaries, leaders, and trailblazers. Capricorns like Dolly Parton, Michelle Obama, Katie Couric, Mary J. Blige, and John Legend are all known for their poise, sophistication, and — of course — unrivaled talents. Capricorns are dynamic individuals who express a unique balance of confidence and humility: They have a grounded, practical spirit that makes people feel comfortable in their presence. Although they're very selective about who they let into their lives, Capricorns are incredibly gracious friends who pride themselves on honesty and loyalty. One important thing to note: Capricorns definitely don't sugarcoat. If a Capricorn doesn't approve of your choices or behavior, they will be sure to let you know. But the great thing about Capricorn is that they will also help you come up with solutions, action items, and practical ideas on how to improve your situation.\n\n\nCapricorns are do-ers, which means they're all about making it happen. You know that expression, 'If you want something done, give it to a busy person?' Well, that's definitely the way Capricorn rolls. Even if Capricorn is knee-deep in deadlines and high-stakes crises, they will go out of their way to consider the needs of their closest companions. What are Capricorn's weaknesses? Of course, Capricorn must remember that not everyone wants, needs, or desires the same lifestyle Capricorn lives. Although Capricorn is extremely ambitious — and their determination is undoubtedly extremely inspiring — it's important that Capricorn doesn't impose their standards on others. It's no problem when Capricorn focuses on their own aspirations… but projecting their values on their closest friends and family is a totally different story.\n\n\nCapricorn must remember to keep their eyes on their own paper: After all, not everyone wants to climb the ladder straight to the top. Some folks just want to live a calm, relaxed, and peaceful existence — and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. What's more, every Capricorn should definitely cultivate a gratitude practice. Because Capricorn has such lofty goals, it's difficult for this earth sign to appreciate their current reality, believing that nothing will be good enough until they reach the mountain's peak. But the journey is the destination and, likewise, by finding deep appreciation for their current blessings, Capricorn will be sure to feel even more fulfilled when they finally reach their desired outcome. Who should Capricorn avoid? Capricorns can connect with all zodiac signs — the only condition, however, is that they don't stand in this sea goat's way. Because Capricorn doesn't have time for petty games, this sign values honesty and transparency. Frankly, they would prefer if someone was super blunt — yes, perhaps even kinda harsh — because they absolutely cannot stand people-pleasing and ego-stroking. Of course, not all signs vibe with Capricorn's serious, stoic spirit: Fire signs — Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius — might find Capricorn's stern essence a bit drab, while the air signs — Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius — can be turned off by Capricorn’s judgmental tone. \n\n\nAlthough Capricorn can make a dynamic work with any zodiac sign, these sea goats must remember that not every person appreciates 'tough love.' Who's the best match for Capricorn? Romantically speaking, Capricorns are seeking an anchor: These loyal lovers are busy as f*ck, so they appreciate loyalty, consistency, and steadfast commitment. Fellow earth signs — Taurus and Virgo — are attracted to Capricorns' ambition, determination, and hardworking spirit, so Capricorn will often fortify deep connections with these like-minded zodiac signs. The water signs — Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces — are also excellent fits for Capricorn: The water signs are sensitive, compassionate, and psychologically deep, so they can actually help Capricorn connect with their intuitive qualities. Remember, Capricorn is represented by the sea goat, so this sign does, intuitively, know how to navigate more emotional terrain.",

Appropriately symbolized by the celestial twins, this air sign was interested in so many pursuits that it had to double itself. Because of Geminis' intrinsic duality, they're often falsely misrepresented as two-faced. In reality, however, Gemini rarely has a hidden agenda. Playful and intellectually curious, Gemini is constantly juggling a variety of passions, hobbies, careers, and friend groups. They are the social butterflies of the zodiac: These quick-witted twins can talk to anyone about anything. Find them buzzing between happy hours, dinner parties, and dance floors. Gemini season begins on May 21, a day that ushers in the heat and electricity of summer. Gemini is accordingly excellent at guiding change and transformation. These curious twins are terrific pioneers, using their energy to spearhead innovative creative projects.\n\n\nA fearless thinker, Gemini is always down to try something new. But after they have shared their progressive vision with the world, it’s best to let these twins get back to ideating: These hyperactive air signs have short attention spans and are most satisfied when they can move fluidly from one idea to the next. Both Gemini and Virgo are governed by Mercury, the messenger planet of communication. Despite sharing a planetary ruler, however, these two signs are opposite in their approaches: Gemini expresses emotions externally, whereas Virgo processes internally. Gemini is all about output, so these twins love to chat and often speak with their hands (which happens to be the body part associated with Gemini). Communication is paramount for them, and they require fluent streams of transmission. They love texting and tweeting almost as much as they love talking IRL. In fact, the act of expression is often even more important to loquacious Gemini than what is actually being said — and they must remember to be thoughtful with their words. Another incredible Gemini quality, however, is that these natural chameleons can quickly recover from even the most shameful foot-in-mouth moments. Gemini moves too fast to care about embarrassing missteps: They simply move on.",

They’re delighted to embrace their royal status: Vivacious, theatrical, and passionate, Leos love to bask in the spotlight and celebrate themselves. These lions are natural leaders and they enjoy cultivating friendships and romances that are artistically and creatively inspired. Playful Leos have no problem leaning into drama-fueled romances that are perfectly suited for the tabloids. (In fact, they may even prefer them.) After all, every Leo perceives him or herself as a celebrity. These astrological divas never get tired of lavish dinners, exclusive parties, or decadent designer wear, Leo is ruled by the sun, the dazzling celestial body that governs life and vitality.\n\n\nThe sun never goes retrograde, and likewise, Leos are renowned for their stability, loyalty, and consistency. They are dedicated friends and lovers who put their hearts into every relationship. (Fittingly, the Leo sign governs the heart.) Lions love to watch their mates succeed — until they feel threatened. They can become impaired by their ego, pride, and jealousy when they start to fear their star power will be eclipsed. It’s important for celestial lions to remember that their light is never obscured by others, and the bright shine of others' success does nothing to their own. Ultimately, Leos' own hubris is the greatest threat to their happiness. This fixed sign is known for its ambition and determination, but above all, Leos are celebrated for their remarkable bravery. In tarot, Leo is represented by the “strength” card, which depicts the divine expression of physical, mental, and emotional fortitude. Fearless optimists who refuse to accept failure, Leos will find their deep wells of courage grow as they mature.",

These air signs are the aesthetes of the zodiac: Ruled by Venus, the planet that governs love, beauty, and money, Libras adore high art, intellectualism, and connoisseurship. Suave Libras need to surround themselves with stunning objects and create environments that reflect their exquisite tastes. Accordingly, these air signs make excellent designers, decorators, art critics, and stylists. While Libra's opposite sign, Aries, represents 'me,' Libra symbolizes 'we.' Relationships are paramount for Libras, who find balance in companionship. They love harmonious partnerships with fashionable mates, especially those who make attractive arm candy. (Libra governs the skin, and these air signs are highly motivated by physical appearance. There's no better way for a Libra to relax than with a luxurious face mask.) Libras, when they are regularly coupled, must be careful about seeking attention outside the agreed-upon boundaries of their relationship. Since they try to keep everyone happy and engaged, they may find themselves tempted to push the limits of their agreements with their partners.\n\n\nPeople-pleasing Libras must remember that the happiness of their loved ones and the health of their relationships is more important than maintaining the attention of distant admirers. Libra is a cardinal sign, which means Libras are accordingly great at launching new initiatives. However, because Libras consider multiple perspectives in all pursuits, these air signs struggle with indecision. Instead of constantly seeking outside perspectives, Libras would do well to develop (and trust) their own intuition. Their characteristic ambivalence aside, Libras can navigate virtually any social situation, effortlessly resolving conflicts by simply turning on the charm.",

This makes these fish the most psychic, empathetic, and compassionate creatures of the astrological wheel. With such immense sensitivity, Pisces can easily become swallowed by emotions and must remember to stay grounded in the material realm (appropriately, Pisces rules the feet). Pisces is ruled by Neptune, the celestial body that governs creativity and dreams, and these ethereal fish adore exploring their boundless imaginations. In its more nefarious form, however, Neptune also oversees illusion and escapism. Neptunian energy is like the energy of the ocean: magical, mysterious, and often scary.\n\n\nWhen the fog is thick on the water, the horizon is obstructed and there is no differentiation between the sea and the sky.

This water sign should remember that problems can't be solved by swimming away. Willful ignorance never makes conflict disappear: It only gives it the chance to grow.A mutable sign, Pisces effortlessly adapts to their surroundings. These visionary fish have unparalleled access to the collective unconscious through their clairvoyance and make incredible artists and creatives.

            "description": "There is no zodiac sign like Sagittarius. What makes Sagittarius so unique is its dynamic blend of passion, curiosity, intensity, and adaptability. Represented by the archer (a half-man, half-horse centaur), Sagittarius isn't afraid to use its bow and arrow to explore expansive terrain, seeking answers in places and spaces others wouldn’t dare venture. Whether they're white water rafting down a river in some undisclosed location or taking a pilgrimage to a sacred site to uncover secrets about an ancient civilization, Sagittarius’ quest for knowledge knows no bounds. Sagittarius is a mutable sign, meaning it is associated with adaptability and flexibility. This perfectly reflects the archers' deep-rooted desire for change. Sagittarians are born to explore and it is critical that these archers have the freedom to roam. (Sagittarius rules the thighs, so these archers are always on the move.) Fueled by wanderlust, these archers can be found traversing all corners of the world on thrill-seeking expeditions, chasing after geographical, intellectual, and spiritual adventures. Sagittarians are on a perpetual quest for knowledge, which makes them incredible storytellers, entertainers, and creatives. It's not all fun and games, however: Sagittarius is notorious for its signature bluntness, and their 'brutal honesty' can often lead to misunderstandings, communication breakdowns, and lots of hurt feelings. But the good news? Sagittarius doesn't take anything too seriously, so it's hard to stay mad at these wild optimists. Sagittarius' ruling planet is Jupiter, the planet of abundance. You know the expression 'go big or go home?' Yeah, that’s basically Jupiter's motto. Jupiter is all about excess — it expands anything it touches. So, naturally, this sign demands to have it all. The word  'enough' doesn't exist within this sign's vocabulary. When Sagittarius is intrigued by something — whether it's a Wikipedia blackhole or a newfound internet crush — they go all in. That is, until something else catches their eye. As a mutable sign, Sagittarius don't stay on any single fascination for too long; these archers have so many passions and interests, they’re constantly bouncing from one idea to the next! What's more, since 2020, the solar and lunar eclipses have been activating the Gemini-Sagittarius axis, so there's been tons of movement and transformation for this fiery sign. Be sure to check this month's Sagittarius horoscope for insight on Sagittarius' latest journey.\n\n\nWhat is a Sagittarius known for? This should come as no surprise: Celebrity Sagittarius like Miley Cyrus, Nicki Minaj, Britney Spears, and Jay-Z are all known for their larger-than-life spirits. Sags are captivating characters who can light up any room with their exhilarating tales, infectious laughter, and dynamic charm. Effortlessly magnetic, they easily attract friends and lovers with their innate humor. Sagittarius are definitely the comedians of the zodiac, who infuse all of their conversations with their signature 'no bullshit' attitude. They're fun, playful, and extremely philosophical. They seamlessly weave stories, fusing topics ranging from quantum physics to 18th-century literature to modern-day celebrity pop culture. Why? Sagittarius is interested in absolutely everything. Their spirit is fueled by their passion for knowledge, so they relish the opportunity to become experts in… well, anything. What are Sagittarius's weaknesses? Of course, Sagittarians must remember to keep their sharp tongues in check. Though they know a lot, they don't know everything — and if they're not careful, they can come off as pretentious or arrogant. Sagittarius has no filter (like, actually, it doesn't exist), which is what makes this fire sign so incredibly funny, intelligent, and dynamic, but is also why they can end up scorching even their closest friends and family on a bad day. What's more, because of Sagittarius' insatiable wanderlust, it's hard for this sign to commit. Consistency is a challenge for these fiery archers, and — although it doesn't come from an ill-intentioned place — other zodiac signs may perceive Sagittarius as flakey and unreliable. To mitigate this, Sagittarius should make sure they don't over-promise, which will inevitably lead to under-delivering. Instead, Sagittarius should make sure they're being extremely transparent about their existing responsibilities so that others can manage their expectations accordingly. Who should Sagittarius avoid? Sagittarius can get along with any zodiac sign—so long as the other person gives them the space to roam.\n\n\nWhether they’re meandering through philosophical conversations or backpacking across distant terrain, Sagittarians are fueled by freedom. Of course, not all signs can tolerate Sagittarians' thrill-seeking spirit. Sagittarius's unpredictable nature may make grounded Earth signs—Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn — a bit uneasy. Similarly, the emotional water signs — Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces — might take Sagittarius's blunt commentary a bit too personally, resulting in lots of hurt feelings. Although Sagittarius can work with any zodiac sign, it must be extra careful with friends and lovers who could use a bit more empathy.",

They also crave the physical closeness, spiritual illumination, and emotional intimacy sex can provide. Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, the planet that governs both destruction and transformation. On a good day, Scorpion energy is ambitious and enticing. On a bad day, however, the shadowy side of Scorpio is fueled by a relentless desire for control. Power-hungry Scorpios must remember that if controlled by their egos, they are at risk of poisoning themselves. This sign is at its best when that intrinsic intensity is applied to deep, soulful connections with friends and lovers. When they build trust with others, Scorpios demonstrate unparalleled empathy, depth, and commitment that brighten even the darkest parts of Scorpio’s magical psyche.",

Fixed signs are excellent at maintaining systems and Taureans prioritize consistency and reliability in all areas of their lives. It must be noted, however, that Taurus does have a bit of a reputation: What a Taurus perceives as dedication is often regarded by others as stubbornness. Accordingly, these bulls may end up lingering in unhealthy situations — whether relationships, jobs, or homes — longer than necessary just to prove a point. Despite their occasional obstinance, however, Taureans are dependable partners, soothing their friends and lovers with their trustworthiness and devotion.",
